Comprehensive Code Quality Checklist

Readability and Maintainability

[ ] Code uses consistent naming conventions

[ ] Names clearly describe purpose (variables, functions, classes)

[ ] Functions/methods are small and focused (ideally <25 lines)

[ ] Comments explain "why" not "what"

[ ] Code is properly indented and formatted

[ ] Complex logic includes explanatory comments

[ ] Documentation exists for public APIs

Structural Principles

[ ] No code duplication (DRY principle)

[ ] Simplest solution used for problems (KISS principle)

[ ] No speculative features (YAGNI principle)

[ ] Clear separation of concerns between components

[ ] Modules have clear, single purposes

[ ] Appropriate design patterns used where beneficial

SOLID Principles

[ ] Classes have single responsibility

[ ] Code extends functionality without modifying existing code

[ ] Derived classes can substitute for base classes

[ ] Interfaces are client-specific rather than general

[ ] High-level modules depend on abstractions, not details

Testing and Quality

[ ] Unit tests cover critical functionality

[ ] Integration tests verify component interactions

[ ] Edge cases are tested

[ ] Tests are independent and repeatable

[ ] Code reviews conducted regularly

[ ] Static analysis tools configured and used

Security and Error Handling

[ ] All inputs validated and sanitized

[ ] Errors handled gracefully with appropriate messaging

[ ] Exception handling is specific, not catch-all

[ ] Sensitive data properly protected

[ ] Proper authentication/authorization implemented

[ ] Defensive coding practices used

Performance

[ ] Appropriate data structures used for operations

[ ] Algorithms chosen with appropriate complexity

[ ] Resources properly released when no longer needed

[ ] Performance bottlenecks identified and addressed

[ ] Caching implemented where appropriate

Functional Programming Principles

[ ] Functions avoid side effects where possible

[ ] Immutable data used where appropriate

[ ] Pure functions preferred for core logic

[ ] Complex operations built through function composition

[ ] Higher-order functions used to reduce repetition

Invariants and Contracts

[ ] Class invariants documented and enforced

[ ] Loop invariants identified and maintained

[ ] Data structure invariants protected

[ ] Preconditions verified before execution

[ ] Postconditions confirmed after execution

[ ] Assertions used to verify critical assumptions

Additional Best Practices

[ ] Operations are idempotent where appropriate

[ ] Errors detected and reported early (fail fast)

[ ] Methods either change state OR return information

[ ] Versioning strategy implemented

[ ] Proper logging throughout application

[ ] Configuration separated from code

[ ] Dependencies explicitly managed

[ ] Technical debt tracked and addressed systematically

This checklist can serve as a comprehensive guide to review your codebase against established coding principles. Not every item will apply to every project or language, so adapt it to your specific context.
