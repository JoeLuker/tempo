# Experiment 5: Edge Case - High Parallelism
# Goal: Test with very low threshold to create many parallel tokens

experiment_name: "edge_case_high_parallelism"
description: "Test behavior with maximum parallel token width"

# Generation config
prompt: "The quick brown"
max_tokens: 8
selection_threshold: 0.03  # Very low = many parallel tokens
seed: 42

# Run both modes
run_both_modes: true

# TEMPO settings
use_retroactive_removal: false
use_custom_rope: true
debug_mode: false

# Output settings
output_dir: "./experiments/results/exp5_high_parallelism"

# Capture settings
capture_attention: true
capture_logits: true
save_attention_matrices: true
save_full_distributions: true

# Expected observations:
# - Steps with 10+ parallel tokens
# - Test if model still produces same results in both modes
# - Higher computational load on attention masking
# - Potential numerical issues with many same-position tokens
