# Experiment 3: Cross-Parallel Attention Measurement
# Goal: Measure attention between parallel tokens at same position

experiment_name: "cross_parallel_attention"
description: "Measure how much parallel tokens attend to each other in visible mode"

# Generation config
prompt: "The cat sat on the"
max_tokens: 15
selection_threshold: 0.08  # Lower threshold for more parallel tokens
seed: 42

# TEMPO settings
use_retroactive_removal: false
allow_intraset_token_visibility: true  # VISIBLE - we want to measure this
use_custom_rope: true
debug_mode: false

# Output settings
output_dir: "./experiments/results/exp3_cross_parallel"

# Capture settings
capture_attention: true
capture_logits: false

# What to measure:
# - For each logical step with parallel tokens [t1, t2, t3, ...]
# - Extract attention submatrix: attention[ti, tj] for all i,j
# - Compute statistics: mean, max, variance of cross-parallel attention
# - Compare to attention to prior context
